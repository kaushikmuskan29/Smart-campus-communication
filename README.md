# Smart Campus Communication Hub

The Smart Campus Communication Hub is a role-based web application designed to centralize and streamline communication within a college campus.

## Overview
This system allows students, faculty, and administrators to access information based on their roles. Administrators can publish announcements, event updates, and important notices, while students and faculty can view relevant updates in real time. The platform removes the dependency on scattered communication channels such as WhatsApp groups or physical notice boards.

## Features
- Role-based access for students, faculty, and administrators
- Centralized announcement and notice management
- Real-time access to campus updates
- Clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface
- Scalable and modular frontend architecture

## Tech Stack

## Implementation
- Built using a component-based architecture for better code reusability and maintainability

## Objective
